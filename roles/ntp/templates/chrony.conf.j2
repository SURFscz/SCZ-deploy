# leap second slew
# The first directive is necessary to disable the clock step which would reset
# the smoothing process. The second directive limits the slewing rate of the
# local clock to 1000 ppm, which improves the stability of the smoothing
# process when the local correction starts and ends. The third directive
# enables the server time smoothing process. It will start when the clock gets
# to 00:00:00 UTC and it will take 17 hours 34 minutes to finish. The
# frequency offset will be changing by 0.001 ppm per second and will reach a
# maximum of 31.623 ppm. The leaponly option makes the duration of the leap
# smear constant and allows the clients to safely synchronise with multiple
# identically configured leap smearing servers.
